          <h1>Post 15-11-2013</h1>
          <p>Let's see how our database model will be</p>
          <p>First, we want to have some users, which will have a name, a unique email, a password and a profile pic.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we need a bill table, which will have an author (e.g. a User id) </p>
          <p>To know who's on the bill, we'll need a bill user table with the bill id & the user id. Then we'll be able really simply to get every person from a bill</p>
          <p>To help us with the bill creation, we'll create some groups. The groups will allow us select at the beginning every people from the group for a new bill. After that we would like to be able to select only person from a group with a checkbox (facebook like render for people participating at a event for example)</p>
          <p>Finally, we need the user from a group to be in a table as well.</p>
          <p>We didn't change the picture yet, but there would probably not be a group parameter in the Bills table anymore.</p>
          <p>Like i said, we we'll need a groups table to register all the groups</p>
