          <h1>Post 15-11-2013</h1>
          <p>Let's see how our database model will be</p>
          <p>First, we want to have some users, which will have a name, a unique email, a password and a profile pic.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we need a bill table, which will have an author (e.g. a User id) </p>
          <p>To know who's on the bill, we'll need a bill user table with the bill id & the user id. Then we'll be able really simply to get every person from a bill</p>
          <p>To help us with the bill creation, we'll create some groups. The groups will allow us select at the beginning every people from the group for a new bill. After that we would like to be able to select only person from a group with a checkbox (facebook like render for people participating at a event for example)</p>
          <p>Finally, we need the user from a group to be in a table as well.</p>
          <p>We didn't change the picture yet, but there would probably not be a group parameter in the Bills table anymore.</p>
          <p>Like i said, we we'll need a groups table to register all the groups</p>

          <p>We designed our render views for the entire project. It might change with time, but here there are : </p>

          <h1>Post 20-11-2013</h1>
          <p>We put on Heroku the first few pages with the user creation and session handling. That's what we presented in class for our presentation. We also worked a lot on a tutorial on RoR to have an understanding of how RoR works.</p>

          <h1>Post 30-11-2013</h1>
          <p>We both finished our tutorial on RoR and are now ready to code. </p>
          <p>We also implemented a profile picture for the users. They can of course update their profile picture (which will delete the older one) and their profile picture is deleted when the user is deleted. </p>
          <p>We now have an admin user who is able to delete users.</p>
          <p>We started implementing the bill task to add a bill to a user.</p>
          <p> This is it for now. See you soon.</p>
